            <p> Hangman is written in Python and displayed using the Tkinter GUI. This program embodies the 
                classic game of Hangman-- The computer chooses a random word of a certain category that the player
                must guess letter-by-letter. With each incorrect guess, a body part is added to Bob, our to-be-hanged man.
                 Once Bob gains all of his body parts, the player loses. If the player manages to correctly guess the word
                 before Bob is hanged, the player wins!

            <p> The Hangman game first chooses a randomized word out of 5 categories within a database.
                A graphical keyboard is diplayed at the bottom of the screen which is for the user to choose their letters
                 that they guess to be a part of the given word. Each incorrectly-guessed letter on the keyboard 
                 turns red and is disabled, while each correctly guessed letter replaces its space in the word and 
                 also becomes disabled. Either a "game over" or "you win" screen is displayed depending on if all the 
                 body parts appear under the scaffold, or if all the letter of the word are filled. 
            </p>

                </div>
            <p>
                In future updates, Hangman could include a timer to add a layer of time pressure on the players. 
                If they fail to guess the word within the time limit, the game over screen 
                appears. Another idea is to introduce power-ups that offer hints or extra guesses to aid players.
