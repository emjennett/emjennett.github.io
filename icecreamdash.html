            <p> Ice Cream Dash is a Java-based game where you are tasked with filling an ice cream cone with specific
                toppings. The menu display informs the player which toppings are needed to be stacked on the cone
                to complete the order. With each incorrect topping that is stacked, the player loses a life.
                If the player loses all 3 possible lives, the game is over. If they manage to stack all the necessary
                toppings within their 3 lives, they win the game!

            </div>
            <p> Ice Cream Dash utilizes hitboxes whose 
                sizes are calculated from the topping's size and the y-position of the cone. 
                Since each topping has a different size, there is one specific hitbox for each topping.
                 Toppings are painted continuously using a falling function, which is set to False once 
                 there is an intersection with a hitbox. With further
                developments,   </p>

                    <p>future</p>
                </div>
            <p>
                For future developments, Ice Cream Dash can use a varying speed factor for the falling toppings. This can be
                introduced as the player progresses through the game in order to increase the difficulty.
                 Ice Cream Dash can also add a layer of competitiveness. An addition 
                of a database can provide a means for not only competing with personal best scores, but also with
                other players. This will encourage players to continue their efforts to beat their fellow Ice Cream 
                Dash players!
