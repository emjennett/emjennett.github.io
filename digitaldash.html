            <p> Our project is a food reviewing program which allows the user to view affiliated restaurants 
                and their individual dishes, including price, rating, and description. 
                The Program allows users to document their tried dishes and experiences through reviews, 
                acquiring points for their profile, and compete with other users for a higher score. 
                Restaurants can upload their menus and see diners' experience with their restaurant.

            <p> The Hangman game first chooses a randomized word out of 5 categories within a database.
            A graphical keyboard is diplayed at the bottom of the screen which is for the user to choose their letters
            that they guess to be a part of the given word. Each incorrectly-guessed letter on the keyboard 
            turns red and is disabled, while each correctly guessed letter replaces its space in the word and 
            also becomes disabled. Either a "game over" or "you win" screen is displayed depending on if all the 
            body parts appear under the scaffold, or if all the letter of the word are filled.

            <p style= "margin-top:0px;"> Abdelrazak is a restaurant owner who wants to open a new location that is too small to offer
                all the available plates in his main location. He opens his restaurant page and sorts the plates offered
                by review and picks the most preferred meals to be in his new location.

                For future developments, Digital Dining Divas can incorporate a flagging system to be able to restrict
                inappropriate, irrelevant, and malicious content. This would of course be permissable by specific agents
                such as restaurant owners and/or the administrators of the site. Further, this application can have a 
                data analytics page accessible by the administrator.
